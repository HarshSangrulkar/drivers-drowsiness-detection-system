# Drivers Drowsiness Detection System using OpenCV

Overview:
This project focuses on detecting drowsiness in drivers using computer vision techniques with the OpenCV library. The system monitors the driver's facial features and alerts them if signs of drowsiness are detected.

Requirements:
Python 3.x
OpenCV
Dlib
SciPy
NumPy

Usage:
Data Preprocessing:

Ensure that the camera is properly positioned to capture the driver's face.
Adjust lighting conditions for optimal performance.
Model Training:

Use a pre-trained facial landmark detection model from Dlib for detecting facial landmarks.
Drowsiness Detection:

Monitor the driver's eyes using OpenCV.
Utilize metrics such as eye aspect ratio (EAR) to detect drowsiness.
Alerting Mechanism:

Press Esc key to disable camera
